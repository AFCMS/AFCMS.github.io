# Hi everyone!

## The Begining

I have a passion for computers. I especially like to play games with my friends and program things.

I started programming about 3 years ago and learned more and more programing languages with the time.

I now know **Lua**, **Python**, **Javascript** and started exploring the possibilities of all the web technologies.

I also make 3d Models, Renders and VFX with **Blender**.

I even made short action films (up to 30mn) with friends (scenario, recording, video editing, vfx, etc)

## Minetest

I discovered the [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net) project by looking for "Minecraft" in my Software Center and tried it... by launching the Windows version with Wine!!! Since that moment, I used to play it every single day, gradually increasing my personal mods collection.
