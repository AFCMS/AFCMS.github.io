# Hi everyone!

## The Begining

I have a passion for computers. I especially like to play games with my friends and program things.

I started programming about 3 years ago and learned more and more programing languages with the time.

I now know **Lua**, **Python**, **JavaScript** and started exploring the possibilities of all the web technologies.

I also make 3D Models, Renders and VFX with **Blender**.

I even made short action films (up to 30mn) with friends (scenario, recording, video editing, vfx, etc)

## Minetest

I discovered the [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net) project by looking for "Minecraft" in my Software Center and tried it... by launching the Windows version with Wine!!! Since that moment, I used to play it every single day, gradually increasing my personal mods collection.

Around six months later, I made my first mod, which was adding a jetpack to the game (this thing never worked properly btw).

Then, I discovered the **MineClone2** subgame, and I quickly started to contribute to it.

I am now one of the active developpers of the project and have also created a bunch of mods for it.

At the end of 2021, I also won the second place of the [Minetest Game Jam](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=27512) by creating [Subway Miner](https://github.com/AFCMS/Subway-Miner), a game inspired by both _Subway Surfers_ and _Temple Run_.

My secret hope is to create a minigame **MineClone2** server, similar to Minecraft _Hypixel_ ;).
If you are interested or own a dedicaced server, feel free to contact me.

## Discord

Who doesn't like Discord?? I am a huge fan of it. I made some Discord bots using **Discord.js** (nothing public for now).
I started making a bot for team management and hope I will get the needed time and inspiration to release it soon ;)

## Artistic Work

Before I started to programm, I used to spend most of my free time creating 3D work using **Blender**
With my one of my best friend, I made 3D models and animations, renders, and even games using the **Blender Game Engine**.

At the same time, we also made short action films (up to 30mn), based on stories we made ourself. This was a pretty intresting activity as it allowed me to learn video editing and VFX.
